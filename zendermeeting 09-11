- Polar Angle: 180 (straight down - downwelling), 0 (straight up - upwelling)
- Cosine polar angle important because polar angle = 0, cos polar angle = 1 means all light hits surface (downwelling)
- Illuminace: cosine-weighted quantity (total energy coming down)


- Make 2D contour plot of lmn_bb_aa (vertical - level pressure, horizontal - polar angle) 
- Make a line plot of lmn_bb_aa_ndr (vertical - levp, curve - variable values)
- Make a line plot of ilm_dwn (vertical - levp, curve - variables values)
- ONE color curve for control, one color curve for experiment
- For contour plot, contour plot of control, contour plot of experiment, contour plot experiment - control (difference)
