Skyglow project
- Looking at light intensity with or without aerosols (how much brighter will it be at night after injecting aerosols in atmopshere i.e. geoengineering)
- dust.ess.uci.edu/smn (list of seminars)
  - Seminar on Skyglow (smn skg gwnia 201702)
  - Datasets in /tmp
- Injecting sulphate aeorosl into stratosphere
- mewcd = microcadelas'
- Studies show urban brightness increases by 25% all levels 
- Illuminance takes into account hemispheric light.... Brightness only looks at light from zenith (vertical)
- Diffuse Starlight Fraction = How much light coming from stars get scattered 
- Nadir = coming from top (someone sees from surface)
- lumen/sterradian = candela
- candela/m2 = lumen/(m2 * sterradian)
- Plot in readable units (millilumens for example)
- ctl = no geoengineering; xpt = with geoengineering
- SI = Lux... Watt/m^2 (All Zender plots)

- Need to get netcd files and operator @ nco.sourceforge.net
- Example script code in skg.sh (under justin file)
- Zender wants you to generate plots from scripts similar to Powerpoint Presentation lol
- Assignment: Create contour plot of sky brightness (luminence) as a function of polar angle (angle from zenith)
 - Different colors from different sky brightness
 - Broadband azimuthally averaged of polar angle
 - Create new script that does contour plot
- ncks stuff in email provides easy way to look at files
- Panoply (Quick look tool to see plots)
